## Abducted Aliens

Aliens have been abducted! They are now on Earth doing their best to fit into society. You'll see Cowboys/Cowgirls, Laser Eyes with Headphones, Baseball Cap with VR headsets, and originals roaming the streets on planet Earth. They have taken over Area 51 and using it as their homebase to conquer the world.
